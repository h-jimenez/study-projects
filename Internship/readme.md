## Intership - Musical Gesture and Motion Capture
### PRISM Laboratory, Marseille

During my two-month internship at the [PRISM Laboratory](https://www.prism.cnrs.fr/en/), I focused on the motion capture of musical gestures. My work centered on defining what constitutes a musical gesture and how these can be described. Using [Move.ai](https://www.move.ai/) technology, we created 3D models of musicians playing their instruments. The primary goal of the internship was to create a comprehensive database of gestures for analysis, composed of a 3D animation and its associated sound.


I developed a Python software that processes two files: an ```.fbx``` file for the animation and a ```.wav``` file for the sound. This software analyzes both files, resulting in a ```.aap``` file, which is a binary container holding both the animation and audio, and a ```.json``` file containing semantic and analytic data as described on the following picture.


Additionally, I used Unity 3D to create a player/sequencer that synchronizes animations with audio. I developed a script that allows us to directly load .aap files and extract the assets from them. This project allowed me to enhance my programming skills, deepen my knowledge of databases, and contribute to innovative research in the field of musical gestures and motion analysis.
