All my various projects gathered in one place

## Personnal project :
### Microtone - _Microtonal MIDI tuner_
Microtone's goal is to open microtonality to anyone who wants to explore new sounds with a simple tool. You can play with it using a regular MIDI piano and your favorite synth VST.

Achieve new harmonies, use uncommon scales and try bringing microtonality in your music.

***- Features :***
- Select a microtonal scale and a root key. Microtone remaps inputs with according pitch starting from the root key note using pitchwheel messages through MPE.
- Scale circle showing the repartition of notes along the scale.
- Real-time visualization of notes played (key and cents variations).

***- Planned :***
- Custom scale creation.
- MIDI visual arpeggiator using the scale circle.
- Microtonal notations
- Better UI

    - Little project as an introduction to openFrameworks. It's a simple flanger using a ring buffer. I added my personnal touch with a fun interface just to explore a bit more concerning graphics.
